This is my personal repo for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
solutions.

I used this year as a chance to brush up on my Kotlin. Though the AOC challenges
aren't always the perfect demonstration for many Kotlin features -- which shine most
in larger codebases with asynchronous work -- it was definitely an interesting, fun,
and fairly efficient way to solve these challenges.

You can find the code for each day under `app/src/main/kotlin`, with unit tests in
the corresponding directories under `app/src/test/kotlin`. Keep in mind that some of
the code does contain spoilers for the solutions!

The runtimes for each day are listed below (parts 1 & 2 combined, as measured on my
computer):
