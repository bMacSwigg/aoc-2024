This is my personal repo for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions.

I used this year as a chance to brush up on my Kotlin. Though the AOC challenges aren't always
the perfect demonstration for many Kotlin features -- which shine most in larger codebases
with asynchronous work -- it was definitely an interesting, fun, and fairly efficient way to
solve these challenges.

You can find the code for each day under `app/src/main/kotlin`, with unit tests in the
corresponding directories under `app/src/test/kotlin`. Keep in mind that some of the code does
contain spoilers for the solutions!
